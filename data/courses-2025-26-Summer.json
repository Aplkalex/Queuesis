The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us ‘more’ human than previous forms of cultural life.",

The course combines a set of standard in-class lectures and tutorials with an 8-12 day field study trip to a location typically outside Hong Kong. The field study trip will consist of both supervised student-led field research and formal face-to-face teaching including such things as guest lectures with local experts, formal professor-guided class discussions on methodology and archaeological fieldwork, guided museum tours, and local study tours focused on the cultural, political, and economic lives of local people. Students will form small groups to investigate different archaeological topics within the field site, actually “doing” archaeology!\n\nOpen only to anthropology majors or minors, including minors in archaeology and in cultural heritage studies.\n\nThe contents of this course will vary with different instructors and students. Offerings under the same course code, but with different field sites can be taken for credit, up to a maximum of two times.",

    "description": "Pediatric massage therapy is a clinical treatment in traditional Chinese Medicine that is specifically designed for children. It is non-invasive and also demonstrates good therapeutic efficacy on different common pediatric diseases. Since children have their unique physiological and pathological features, many of the acupuncture points like linear points and planar points applied is specific for children. The manual manipulation of pediatric massage therapy, including operating frequency and duration, is also different from that of adult massage therapy. The operation procedures must be light, soft and steady. Specific multiple-style manipulations may be required in addition to the conventional single-style manipulation for pediatric massage therapy.\nThe objectives of the course are to appreciate the development and the features of the current clinical branches of pediatric massage therapy, and to understand the principles of the selection of acupuncture points and manual manipulation in different common pediatric diseases.",

This also provides data for further studies on natural hazards. EESC2119 is an intermediate level, field-based course of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Programme. It covers important aspects of atmospheric sciences, plate tectonics, volcanoes, deformation structures, sedimentology, coastal features, earthquakes and associated present-day infrastructures. The principal goal of this course is to let students study major atmospheric sciences, geological features and understand how tectonic movement and atmospheric phenomenon contribute to the current different landforms, disasters and urban planning. Students are trained to observe, describe and discuss field features. Basic skills of using field tools (e.g. compasses-clinometer), studying geologic maps and making field notes are introduced to help students acquire field data and analyze possible atmospheric phenomenon and geologic processes. A field report is required to summarize the field study logically. The field location and term of offer of this course may change from year to year. Due to limited quota, priority will be given to students who have taken EESC2010 and passed the pre-enrolment quiz.",

    "description": "(UGED2316 is double-coded with FAAS2100.)\n\nIn the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should “外師造化，中得心源” (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the “heart-source” of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field’s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like “氣韻生動” (infusing ch’i to show life movement) or “意趣” (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.\n\nDistant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their “heart-source”. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting “translates” the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists’ cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the “heart-source” of these painters.\n\nThis course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits. The endeavours of the local communities in preserving these invaluable treasures will also be reviewed.",

As VC is a subset of private equity, the course will discuss the management, legal and marketing issues of private equity in general. Topics include raising and structuring private equity funds, the limited partnership, and fund strategies. The course will consider the investment decision of institutional investors in private equity and how funds are structured to meet their needs. It will discuss post-subscription private equity fund management - deal screening, evaluation, negotiation, disbursement, investee management, valuation and exit - and will consider specifically the perspective of the VC investee company - alternative sources of financing, how to approach a VC to maximize chances of success, and governance issues in VC financed firms. The course may also delve into public versus private equity buyouts, valuation of buyouts and corporate restructuring under private equity.",

It aims at leading students to a proficiency level comparable to the threshold from A2 to B1 of the Common European Framework for Languages (CEFR), becoming “independent users” of French. To achieve this goal, students will be encouraged to work project-based through independent or collaborative work with their peers. At the end of this course students will have mastered the most important grammar features of French and be able to communicate effectively in a wide range of everyday situations and a number of professional contexts. They will be able to use their oral and written language skills to relate to, reflect on and analyze past and current issues involving the French-speaking societies.",

    "description": "“Service Learning – Creating a Better World through Diversity and Inclusion” aims to promote diversity and inclusion to the community. The course will create opportunities for students to get in touch with vulnerable groups or minority members in the city. By engaging in a variety of projects or activities such as in-depth visits and interviews, students are expected to understand the environment and difficulties their target groups have been facing. The course consists of lectures, service learning experiences, and self-reflection sessions. Key concepts such as openness, civility, and inclusivity will be discussed in class, while a core principle that no individual and group should be discriminated against based on race, ethnicity, geographic provenance, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, language, ability/disability, or socioeconomic status will be stressed as these values and principles are embraced by the University and are essential to social cohesion. The course also aims to integrate service and learning experiences through community service activities. It seeks to cultivate students’ leadership skills and foster their self-awareness and empathy towards others and the community. In addition, the course also emphasizes reflection on the quality of leadership that demonstrates while providing service, with the particular focus on intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies.\n\nThere will be different sessions under this course that focus on various aspects and subjects under the general theme diversity and inclusion, for example, multicultural groups, Special Educational Needs (SEN), gender equality, etc. Through the delivery of service, the students will be equipped with skills and a positive attitude to tackle social issues through collaborating with different NGO partners, and ultimately, be able to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world settings in meaningful and impactful ways.\n\nDiversity and inclusion are crucial principles of achieving the SDG goals of “Gender Equality” and “Reducing Inequality”. By respecting different cultures and minimizing stereotypes and prejudices, it will promote an atmosphere conducive to “Good Health and Well-being” of our society, with particular concern of mental health.",

At the end of this course students will have mastered the most important grammar features of German and be able to communicate effectively in a wide range of everyday situations and a number of professional contexts. They will be able to use their oral and written language skills to relate to, reflect on and analyze past and current issues involving the German-speaking societies.",

It also enhances the understanding of students of community issues, as well as the capacities and assets of the community, with an aim to promote students’ apprehension of social inclusion. Students will engage in experiential learning to critically study and apply concepts and theories in an authentic, real-world environment through social servicing. To prepare students to care for others, they will first learn to care for themselves through developing loving-kindness, empathy, mindfulness, and respect for diversity. Students will review and reflect on the strengths and real-life needs of the community. Guided by course instructors, students will design and implement service-learning projects by themselves or in association with non-government organizations, social enterprises, or volunteer groups as host organizations. The course concludes with a post-service review in which students will share and reflect on their service-learning experience, re-examine their own self to gain deeper and broader appreciation of how their own discipline and academic knowledge relates to the society, and develop an enhanced sense of civic responsibility and a lifelong commitment.",

The course is divided into two parts: the first part, from a macro perspective, discusses the “position” of festivals and popular religion in the Chinese Imperial State and local society. We will try to discuss (1) how did the Ming Qing Government sanction and control local ritual activities? (2) How did different social groups depict festivals and popular religion in different periods of time? And (3) How did local society utilize the State language to enhance, adjust, reconstruct and forget local traditions? The second part, through case studies, will investigate local social activities’ organizational method and its changes in order to understand the interactive relationship between tradition and modernization. It also attempts to explore the relationship between historical narration and interpretation from analyses of these case studies.",

Those priority risk behaviours causing global burden of diseases are often established early in life and research findings have also confirmed the existence of common determinants (e.g., pathways in the brain) and the inter-relationships between the determinants of risk behaviours and behaviours themselves.\n\nImprovement of behaviours and well-being of citizens would not naturally occur without a specific “intentional intervention”. The concept of Healthy Setting is to cultivate a healthy physical/psycho-social environment in the setting where people spend most of the time for working, studying, enjoyment of life, or for specific purposes. It is a very effective “intentional intervention” in achieving improvements in both health and well-being of citizens as it would penetrate into the wide arrays of their daily experiences. The whole concept of healthy setting is also based on striving the principles of ‘just, equitable and inclusive’ for citizen development. The key to successful implementation is engagement of key stakeholders in strategic way.",

It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:\n\n1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and\n3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society.\n\nUsing concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix. Students are trained to understand the nature and cultural implications of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context. Besides lectures, discussions and readings, this course selectively utilizes topical essays (projects), e-learning, audio-visual materials and fieldwork-based assignments as supplementary teaching tools.",

Advisory: For Japanese Studies Majors in their final year of attendance.\n\nThe Field-Research Based Project, a requirement for all JAS major students, is completed over the course of four years. Preparation for the project begins in year one and year two when students take JAS1010, JAS1050, and JAS1090. In these courses, students gain familiarity with contemporary Japanese politics, economy, culture and society. Students also learn to identify and evaluate academic arguments, locate academic sources, cite sources properly, and identify and assess basic social science and humanities research methods. In the third-year of study, students decide on their research topic and methods, and appropriately apply research methods to collect data for the project. Students who are in the fourth year of study, should have completed data collection and should be writing the paper. Students should have made efforts to speak, read, and write Japanese to achieve their research aims. Students are expected to have used Japanese for activities such as requesting assistance, conducting interviews, creating questionnaires, surveying media sources, and conducting literature reviews. The final-year project completed during the required courses JAS4601 and JAS4602 is thus the final product of the previous three years’ of preparation in both Japanese studies and Japanese language.",

    "description": "Hong Kong is at the crossroads of many legal traditions. The practice of law in Hong Kong is marked not only by the common law tradition but also by socialist law and the civil law tradition. There are even traces left of the pre-colonial indigenous Chinese legal practices in Hong Kong. Globalization has increased the volume of cross-border activities beyond Hong Kong and mainland China, requiring lawyers to become familiar with multi-jurisdictional issues. Consequently, comparative legal work is gaining in importance both globally and in Hong Kong.\n\nThis course is designed to prepare students to practice law in an international setting and to give credit to the growing practical significance of comparative legal work. Students will examine the meaning and instrumental benefits of comparative law, explore how various legal systems and traditions are adapting to change, learn about academic debates within comparative law, and critically analyse traditional concepts of comparative law. They will also learn to appreciate the insights of approaching legal systems through a comparative perspective. This course has an emphasis on Asian legal systems and the law of the People’s Republic of China, in particular.",

Proceeding from an international and comparative perspective, the course examines the system of financial and banking regulations in selected jurisdictions including Hong Kong and other Asian countries. The rule setting process periodically initiated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as international bodies monitoring the global financial system will be introduced. The roles of Hong Kong as BCBS member and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as FSB member will be analysed, particularly with respect to the implementation of rules and standards. While the focus of the course is on banking regulatory law, reference will be made to legal concepts facilitating international financial transactions with relevance for doing business in Hong Kong, such as for example the standards set by the London-based Loan Market Association (LMA) or Islamic finance. Students will also develop problem-solving and legal research, writing, and presentation skills to an appropriate postgraduate level.",

    "description": "This course provides a detailed overview of two principles structural biology methods used for the study of the structure-function relationship biomolecules: cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography. Cryo-EM, a powerful technique involving rapid cooling of biological specimens in vitreous ice to preserve the structure for EM analysis, has become a dominant technique in the field of structural biology. Its board applications range from high-resolution structure determination of protein complexes using single particle analysis to visualization of subcellular structures in their native environment using tomography. On the other hand, X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool in studying small proteins and protein-drug interactions. Today, cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography are indispensable and irreplaceable tools in research to reveal unprecedented architectural details of macromolecular assemblies that are invaluable to our mechanistic understanding of the biological world as well as drug discovery. This course will cover the fundamental principles and concepts with an emphasis on practical aspects of these two fundamental techniques. Basic techniques, such as specimen preparation, machine operation, data acquisition, computational image analysis and structure solving, 3D map interpretation, and model building will be covered. With an emphasis on high-resolution structure determination, this course provides the necessary hands-on experience and entry-level trainings for students to perform cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography in their future research projects.",

Human genome has been fully sequenced, the technologies of neuroimaging have made it possible for researchers to observe a brain in action in living people, and psychology has entered the Decade of the Mind. In this new decade, psychology has been re-defined as a science examining how human mind works in general. Abnormal psychology, on the other hand, specializes in understanding how human mind works when it goes haywire. This course is designed to provide you with the most updated knowledge in the field of psychopathology. You will learn about the key concepts of mental disorders, how mental predispositions and upbringing experience interact in the development of various mental disorders, how human mind works in different mental disorders, and more importantly, how you can continue to learn about the science of psychopathology on your own after you have completed the course. After all, learning is about “learning how to learn.”",

    "description": "China is looming large on the global scene and our everyday life. It is a rising power that is changing the world order. It is a land of promising opportunities that attract an immense amount of capital and talents from overseas. Not to mention that a large part of the stuff we consume is produced in China. However, China is still—at least nominally—a socialist country that continues to embrace one-party rule and political censorship. Through the holistic perspective of anthropology that gives equal emphasis on political, economic, social, cultural, and ecological factors, this course addresses a host of issues that are salient in understanding China and its position in the contemporary world. The anthropological perspective is particularly good at making sense of the macro-level issues through studying day-to-day details and processes in a small locale. This course starts with examining China's revolution-packed modern history and the making of the powerful Communist Party; topics covered include classical anthropological themes on family, kinship, religion, education, ethnicity, identity, and morality. In the second half of the semester, this course examines emerging social concerns to explore how global processes such as modernization and late-capitalist development shape Chinese cultural and social institutions. These concerns include consumerism, individualism, urbanization, underground (unofficial) culture, civil society and activism, and financialization and digitalization. The course also draws from disciplines other than anthropology—for example, history—and some of the finest journalist writings on China. The overall intention is to provide a well-rounded and nuanced understanding of China today. The course prepares students for the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Anthropology has a strong heritage concerning inequality, marginalized group, human and environment, and wellbeing for all. Analyzing China, this course aims at understanding the development and choices of human beings. Therefore, the course will improve students’ reflection on several SDGs including “promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth,” “reducing inequality within and among countries,” “sustainable consumption and production patterns,” and “peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development and providing access to justice for all.”",

After the completion of Human Genome Project, scientists have already unraveled some of the mysteries of how genes manipulate our life. Biotechnology, the use of living organisms to make products, has already led to the new industrial revolution, which creates hundreds of thousand jobs and tens of billion dollars revenue in the United States. This course aims to introduce students some fundamental knowledge of how genes determine and control our appearance and behaviour. Recent discoveries of some genes in inheritable diseases (e.g. cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, etc.), aging and death will be addressed. Successful examples of using biotechnology to improve our medicinal, agricultural and environmental practices will be introduced. Some ethical, legal and social issues generated from genetic research and biotechnology will also be discussed. This course is particularly suitable to those students who are not life science majors but want to understand more on the recent research on human genome and biotechnology, and their impacts on our future worlds.",

This course firstly aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive view on the biological world, starting from the simplest DNA to simple single-celled organisms, and then to more complicated living organisms, and finally to the most complex ecosystems and biosphere; and to guide students to appreciate the Wonders and majesty of the biological world. Students will also be introduced examples of how insights from studying the biological world can improve our health, living quality and environment, and may affect the future societal development. Students will be introduced to examples that are relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals including SDG #3 “Good Heath and Well Being, SDG #7 “Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG #13 “Climate Action” and SDG #15 “Life on Land”. The important roles of biotechnology will be discussed, such as how human diseases can be prevented and treated, and how global climate change can be mitigated.",

Behind the scenes of food enjoyment, lots of science and technology has been applied in their manufacturing processes to ensure that the food products are preserved in high standards of quality, nutrition and safety. Among those food manufacturing and processing methods, however, some of them are quite controversial and thus arouse many public concerns over food safety and security issues.\n\nThis course is designed for the general students to provide them with some key concepts and scientific knowledge in food preservation, processing technology and food safety control, as well as to explore the interactive relationships between them. Through learning the basic properties of foodborne hazards, which are the origins of most food safety problems, students are able to enhance the understandings on the principles and practices of respective food preservation methods and processing technologies. Meanwhile, the potential risks and adverse effects of particular food processing technologies will be discussed. Furthermore, some highly concerning topics and incidents about food safety will be analysed based on scientific facts and discussed from different perspectives. After finishing the course, students are encouraged to use the acquired knowledge to make better food choices, distinguish the fallacies about food and appraise the impact of modern technology on human food safety and security.",

    "description": "In recent years, the United Nations had proposed a global plan aiming to end poverty and protect the globe, and ensure that people living on this planet enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. The goal is going to be achieved and performed by 17 integrated subdivisions, which are also known as the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Biodiversity, conservation, environmental management, and related technologies are essential and are brought together under this bigger theme of sustainability. Biotechnology, here thus plays a great role, as it infiltrates in different part of our lives — from the food we eat to how we collect them, the drugs we take to treat illnesses, the fuel we use to power up devices and even the conservation of biodiversity and the environmental health. While biotechnology is a broad discipline that exploits different biological processes, organisms, cells or cellular components to develop new and effective technologies and is a newly emerged and an ongoing field in biological sciences, it offers opportunities to aid achieving different global matters that are happening currently or in the foreseeable future, especially issues relating but not limited to food crisis, one health, energy shortage, sustainable infrastructure and biodiversity in different habitats, etc.\n\nThis course provides a wide scope of knowledge relating to biotechnology that aims to stimulate thoughts and broaden the horizon of students from different background. It also allows the students to embrace the beauty and understand the constraint, including ethical, social, environmental and technological challenges of biotechnology. This course focuses on three major themes: 1). Introduction of the basic biotechnology knowledge of genetics and extended biotechnology techniques, 2). Showcases of the latest biotechnological developments and applications in various aspects of life sciences, 3). Discussion of key values of biotechnology and the philosophical, moral and ethical issues of biotechnology. Ultimately, this course aims at raising the awareness and promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are related to SDG#2 Zero Hunger, SDG#3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG#7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG#9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG#11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG#14 Life Below Water and SDG#15 Life On Land, to the students.",

It is hoped that through this course students will be able to broaden their knowledge of some key aspects of the history of England integrated into SDGs themes.\n\nStudents, thus, will be more connected to the modern world by understanding the past since some important ideas and inventions are legacies from England. Students will discuss from different perspectives of 'England' in this course, such as political development, intellectual ideology, cultural influences and transformation of society in modern Britain. For example, the concept of 'democracy' is based on the constitution movement and it still affects the modern world (#16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions)The industrial revolution and the changing the modern consumption. (#8 Decent Work and Economic Growth #9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom was a pioneer women movements (#5 Gender Equality)It is hard to understand the shaping of modern world without knowing the role of England in the WWII.Finally, the discussion of the role of Britain in colonial Hong Kong also provides an opportunity for students to understand the legacy of Britain in Hong Kong today.\n\nStudents should be able to review the following SDGs themes, including #5 Gender Equality #8 Decent Work and Economic Growth #9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure #16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions after this course, which fulfills the SDGs goals.",

Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked “smart”-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes—the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives.

    "description": "In this course, we will discuss the direct and indirect health consequences related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations and analyze the wider socioeconomic dimensions of these topics. After the pandemic we faced, we realized that a health crisis will have implications beyond the health sector and development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability. It is therefore important for us, as global citizens, to recognize the issues related and understand how we can take part in this. Traditionally, health indicators have been an important aspect of development indices and health is a foundation of societies. Therefore, our course aims to discuss SDGs through the lens of health, by providing an overview on how the current global challenges on sustainable development impacts the population health and encourage students to look for solutions. We will cover the health-related SDGs by blended learning, including 2. Zero Hunger where we will discuss malnutrition, 3. Good Health and Well-being where we will discuss road injuries, infrastructure and management, 5. Gender Equality where we will discuss intimate partner violence, 6. Clean Water and Sanitation where we will discuss water safety and supply, 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth where we will discuss labor rights and occupational injuries, 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities where we will discuss impacts on health, socioeconomics and environment of inadequate housing and poor living environment, 13. Climate Action where we will discuss Climate-related disasters and disaster risks, and 16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions where we will discuss concept and impact of peace and justice on health.\n\nThrough face-to-face tutorials and case-based discussions, we will discuss selected topics in greater details, including the road safety aspects of Goal 3 “Good health and well-being”, the protection of workers from work-related injuries in Goal 8 “Decent work and economic growth”, the disaster risks in modern developments in Goal 13 “Climate action”, and how to educate the younger generation on the promotion of peace in Goal 16 “Peace, justice and strong institutions”. Development of modern societies and the interaction between humans and environment will be discussed, and through the advocacy framework we will discuss the current challenges related which draw immense global attention, and allow students to exchange interdisciplinary ideas, identify the challenges we are facing and propose advocacy campaign in hope to identify and deliver solutions locally and internationally.",

    "description": "This course examines the challenges and issues faced by Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) individuals when they attempt to adapt themselves to the teaching and learning practices and communication styles in a mainstream postsecondary educational context. This adaptation is particularly challenging when these variables could be fundamentally different from their previous learning experiences. For instance, they may encounter difficulties when they participate in lectures, tutorial or group discussions, presentations, lab work,...etc. resulting in communication barriers and social alienation.\n\nWithin UN’s SDG Framework, the course enables students to achieve a general understanding of the nature and causes of hearing loss (SDG #3: Good Health and Well-Being), and how to reduce communication barriers while dispelling misconceptions and negative attitudes towards D/HH individuals (SDG #10: Reduced Inequalities). Additionally, the course examines how the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) tackles issues relating to deafness, sign language, Deaf communication, and information accessibility in education and public domains. Students will analyze the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by D/HH communities, such as limited access to healthcare, education, and employment. These challenges are explored in the context of how they perpetuate inequality and restrict opportunities for D/HH individuals (SDG #16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). At a broader level, the course underlies the impact of communication barriers on the quality of life and opportunities available to D/HH individuals. It also emphasizes the circumstances within a mainstream postsecondary educational context, D/HH individuals can be afforded equal opportunities and appropriate support to achieve quality education. (SDG #4: Quality Education).\n\nThis course contains 7 themes each of which is packaged with a set of pre-recorded lectures and micromodules supplemented with multimedia resources such as YouTubes, Ted talks, DHH sharings and Deaf documentaries.",

    "description": "(UGED2316 is double-coded with FAAS2100.)\n\nIn the traditional discourse of Chinese painting, it was believed that an artist should “外師造化，中得心源” (outwardly learn from the Nature and inwardly trace the source of their own heart). Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the “heart-source” of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field’s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like “氣韻生動” (infusing ch’i to show life movement) or “意趣” (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.\n\nDistant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life. This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their “heart-source”. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting “translates” the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists’ cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the “heart-source” of these painters.\n\nThis course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in. Through the well-preserved tangible heritage of the region, students could have a better feeling of the intangible ideational world of the ancient masters and their artistic pursuits. The endeavours of the local communities in preserving these invaluable treasures will also be reviewed.",

Students will be engaged in a direct dialogue with literary writers, philosophers and social reformers who address three fundamental questions: What is it that makes a \"good\" life for me? What is it that makes a \"good\" society for everyone? How do I make possible such a \"good\" life and \"good\" society?\n\nStudents are expected to read, discuss, and write about a wide range of texts extracted from influential classics in the humanities East and West. They will be encouraged to discover their own answers to the three questions by considering views and arguments expressed in the texts, and by exploring how far and in what ways such views and arguments may hold true for the contemporary world.\n\nWhere appropriate, the selected classic texts will be given bilingually to help students enter the world of classics and develop confidence and competence in approaching primary texts. Students will meet for one lecture and two tutorial sessions every week. Emphasis will be placed on students’ capacity to respond critically to the selected texts in oral and written presentations, in the form of class discussions, short write-ups and term papers. Class size will be kept small to maximize discussions and to facilitate intensive guidance on academic writing, in Chinese and/or English as specified by the instructor.",

    "description": "This course is an intellectual pursuit across various natural sciences including the two most fundamental ones, physical and biological sciences. Ancient Greek philosophers took the lead in exploring the physical world and the world of life with reason and hence laid the foundations of natural science. This human enquiry into Nature leads to a reflection on the human understanding of Nature and the humans’ place in Nature.\n\nFrom the writings and stories of great scientists selected from influential literatures, students can gain a general understanding of the concepts and methodology of science, and of how scientists relate their academic pursuit to contemporary life, thereby developing their own perspectives on scientific issues. Students will be required to read, discuss and write about a wide range of texts in philosophy, science and its history. Emphasis will be placed on students’ capacity to respond critically to these texts in written as well as oral presentations. Through these learning activities, students are expected to develop a lifelong capacity and enthusiasm to continue such dialogues with science texts in the future.",

This course is designed in the format of a study trip in Hong Kong or a big overseas city. The objectives are three-fold: (1) to introduce students to different techniques in the collection of field data; (2) to help students identify, understand and explain urban problems; and (3) to provide an opportunity for students to work as a team in problem-solving. Students are required to participate actively in all activities throughout the study trip and to submit an individual report afterwards.",
